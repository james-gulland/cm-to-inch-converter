# cm-to-inch-converter

<b>Purpose</b>: focus on having a go with some fancy css, along with some basic html and JavaScript.  Had a lot of fun with this.

A few things I learnt:

- Gradient backgrounds on CSS are super easy lol
- I love the Inter font from Google fonts
- Basic centering on a page is trickier than it ought to be...
- Having fun is a great way of learning

Some improvements to be made:
- Making it properly responsive (it is not currently)
- Improved JavaScript (it was hacked together very quickly)
