# cm-to-inch-converter

<b>Purpose</b>: no specific need or purpose for the tool itself, but I just wanted a platform to try building out some custom CSS from scratch, not following any tutorials, but entirely self-guided to see if I could do it.

<b>End result:</b> https://james-gulland.github.io/cm-to-inch-converter/

<b>Languages used:</b>
- html: very basic divs, nothing special
- css: tried importing Google web fonts for the first time, tried using flexbox for the first time (outside of tutorials), had fun with some button and input styling
- JavaScript: first time I built up a couple of functions from scratch (with no assisted Google help).  Not the finest or most optimised code (might improve it later), but it works :)

<b>A few things I learnt</b>:
- Basic centering on a page is trickier than it ought to be... I learnt a neat trick on using 'height: 100vh;' on the main container to help center vertically, and then using 'flex-direction: column' instead of 'row' to format things nicely.
- Gradient backgrounds on CSS are super easy!
- I love the Inter font from Google fonts
- Having fun is a great way of learning

<b>Some improvements to be made:</b>
- Making it properly responsive (it is not currently)
- Improved JavaScript (it was hacked together very quickly)
